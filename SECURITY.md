3. **Contact the maintainers** if you have educational feedback
4. **For production security issues**, consult with your organization's security team

## Security Considerations for Production Use

If you plan to implement contract testing in production based on these examples:

### ⚠️ Critical Security Requirements

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper authentication mechanisms
   - Use strong, unique credentials
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Enable multi-factor authentication where appropriate

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Implement proper data classification
   - Follow data minimization principles
   - Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

3. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
   - Implement proper network segmentation
   - Use VPNs or private networks for sensitive communications
   - Configure firewalls and access controls

4. **Secret Management**
   - Use dedicated secret management systems
   - Implement secret rotation policies
   - Never store secrets in code or configuration files
   - Use environment-specific configurations

5. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Implement comprehensive logging
   - Set up security monitoring and alerting
   - Monitor for suspicious activities
   - Implement audit trails

6. **Compliance**
   - Ensure compliance with applicable regulations
   - Implement proper data handling procedures
   - Conduct regular security assessments
   - Maintain security documentation
