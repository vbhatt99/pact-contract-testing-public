# PACT Contract Testing Framework

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: This repository is for **educational and testing purposes only**. It provides examples and guidance for learning PACT contract testing concepts. Users are responsible for their own implementation, security, compliance, and production use. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [DISCLAIMER](DISCLAIMER.md) for full terms.

A comprehensive, production-ready PACT-based contract testing framework that covers everything from basic examples to advanced scenarios including bi-directional contracts and performance testing.

## üéØ Purpose

This framework is designed to:
- **Educate** developers on PACT contract testing concepts
- **Demonstrate** best practices and patterns
- **Provide** working examples for learning
- **Guide** implementation of contract testing in real projects

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git (for version control)
- curl (for API testing)
- jq (for JSON processing)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd pact-contract-testing

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Single test (simple example)
npm run test:single         # 1 consumer test suite (3 tests)

# Consumer tests only
npm run test:consumer       # All consumer tests (3 suites, 11 tests)

# Provider tests only  
npm run test:provider       # All provider tests (‚ö†Ô∏è has port conflicts when run together)

# All contract tests (recommended)
npm run test:contract       # Consumer + Provider tests (‚ö†Ô∏è provider tests may have port conflicts)

# Setup and cleanup
npm run setup               # Create test directories
npm run cleanup             # Clean test artifacts
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: `npm run test` runs ALL tests including advanced ones that have issues. Use `npm run test:contract` for complete contract testing.

## üìã All Available Commands

### Test Commands
```bash
npm run test                 # Run all tests (‚ö†Ô∏è includes broken advanced tests)
npm run test:single          # Single test example ‚úÖ (1 suite, 3 tests)
npm run test:consumer        # Consumer tests only ‚úÖ (3 suites, 11 tests)
npm run test:provider        # Provider tests only (‚ö†Ô∏è has port conflicts when run together)
npm run test:contract        # All contract tests (‚ö†Ô∏è provider tests may have port conflicts)
```

### Setup & Cleanup
```bash
npm run setup                # Create test directories
npm run cleanup              # Clean test artifacts
```

## üß™ Test Execution Guide

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Create necessary directories and files
npm run setup
```

**What this does:**
- Creates `logs/` directory for test logs
- Creates `pacts/` directory for PACT contract files
- Ensures clean environment for testing

### Step 2: Consumer Tests (PACT Generation)
```bash
# Run consumer tests to generate PACT contracts
npm run test:single
```

**What this does:**
- Starts PACT mock server
- Runs consumer tests against mock server
- Generates PACT contract files
- Validates consumer expectations

**Expected output:**
```
‚úì should return a list of users
‚úì should return a specific user  
‚úì should return 404 when user does not exist

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       3 passed, 3 total
```

### Step 3: Provider Verification Tests
```bash
# Run provider verification tests
npm run test:provider
```

**What this does:**
- Reads generated PACT contracts
- Sends requests to running provider server
- Validates provider responses match contracts
- Reports verification results

**Expected output:**
```
Verifying a pact between UserServiceConsumer and UserServiceProvider
  a request for all users
    returns a response which
      has status code 200 (OK)
      includes headers "Content-Type" with value "application/json" (OK)
      has a matching body (OK)
```

### Step 4: Complete Test Suite
```bash
# Run both consumer and provider tests
npm run test:contract
```

**What this does:**
- Runs consumer tests (generates contracts)
- Runs provider verification tests
- Provides complete test coverage

### Step 5: Cleanup (Optional)
```bash
# Clean up test artifacts
npm run cleanup
```

**What this does:**
- Removes generated log files
- Removes PACT contract files
- Resets environment for next test run

## üéØ Common Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Time Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run setup
npm run test:contract
```

### Scenario 2: Development Testing
```bash
npm run test:single
npm run test:consumer
npm run test:provider
```

### Scenario 3: Debugging Issues
```bash
npm run cleanup
npm run setup
npm run test:single
```

## üìä Test Results & Status

### ‚úÖ Working Commands
| Command | Status | Results | Best For |
|---------|--------|---------|----------|
| `npm run test:single` | ‚úÖ **PASS** | 1 suite, 3 tests | Learning & beginners |
| `npm run test:consumer` | ‚úÖ **PASS** | 3 suites, 11 tests | Consumer contract testing |
| `npm run setup` | ‚úÖ **PASS** | Creates directories | Environment setup |
| `npm run cleanup` | ‚úÖ **PASS** | Cleans artifacts | Cleanup after testing |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Commands with Known Issues
| Command | Status | Issue | Workaround |
|---------|--------|-------|------------|
| `npm run test:provider` | ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL** | Port conflicts (1 passed, 2 failed) | Run individual provider tests |
| `npm run test:contract` | ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL** | Same port conflicts | Run consumer + individual provider tests |

### üîß Root Cause Analysis
**Port Conflicts**: Multiple provider tests try to start Express servers on port 3001 simultaneously, causing `EADDRINUSE` errors. This is a common issue in PACT testing when multiple provider verification tests run in parallel.

### üéØ Recommended Workflow
1. **Learning**: `npm run test:single` (perfect for beginners)
2. **Consumer Testing**: `npm run test:consumer` (all consumer tests work)
3. **Provider Testing**: Run individual provider tests separately
4. **Complete Testing**: Run consumer tests first, then individual provider tests

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Port Already in Use (Provider Tests)
**Error:**
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3001
```

**Root Cause:** Multiple provider tests try to start servers on port 3001 simultaneously.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill any running processes on port 3001
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9

# Or kill all node processes
pkill -f node

# Then run individual tests instead of all provider tests
npm run test:single
# or
npm run test:consumer
```

**Prevention:** Avoid running `npm run test:provider` or `npm run test:contract` - use individual tests instead.

#### 2. PACT Mock Server Issues
**Error:**
```
Pact mock server failed to start
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clean up and restart
npm run cleanup
npm run setup
npm run test:single
```

#### 3. Provider Tests Failing with Port Conflicts
**Error:**
```
Test Suites: 2 failed, 1 passed, 3 total
listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3001
```

**Root Cause:** Multiple provider verification tests try to start Express servers on the same port simultaneously.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Don't run all provider tests together - use individual tests
npm run test:consumer  # This works perfectly

# For provider testing, run individual tests:
jest examples/provider/__tests__/simpleUserService.verification.test.js
jest examples/provider/__tests__/userService.verification.test.js
jest examples/provider/__tests__/productService.verification.test.js
```

**Why this happens:** The `npm run test:provider` command runs all provider tests in parallel, causing port conflicts. Individual tests work fine.

#### 4. Missing Dependencies
**Error:**
```
Module not found
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

#### 5. Advanced Tests Failing
**Error:**
```
npm run test fails with many test failures
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use the complete contract test suite
npm run test:contract

# Or run individual working tests
npm run test:consumer
npm run test:provider
```

**Why this happens:** The `npm run test` command runs ALL tests including advanced examples that have API compatibility issues. The basic tests work perfectly.

### Emergency Commands

#### Reset Everything
```bash
npm run cleanup
pkill -f node
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run setup
```

#### Quick Health Check
```bash
curl -f http://localhost:3001/health || echo "Provider not running"
npm run security:audit
```

## üìä Test Results Interpretation

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
```
‚úì should return a list of users
‚úì should return a specific user
‚úì should return 404 when user does not exist
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       3 passed, 3 total
```

### ‚ùå Failure Indicators
```
‚úó should return a list of users
Expected: 1, Received: 2
Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 total
Tests:       2 passed, 1 failed
```

### üîç Verification Success
```
Verifying a pact between UserServiceConsumer and UserServiceProvider
  a request for all users
    returns a response which
      has status code 200 (OK)
      includes headers "Content-Type" with value "application/json" (OK)
      has a matching body (OK)
```

## üê≥ Docker Usage (Optional)

While this framework doesn't include Docker implementation, you can containerize your PACT testing setup:

### Basic Docker Setup
```bash
# Example Dockerfile for consumer service
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "run", "test:consumer"]

# Example docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  consumer:
    build: .
    environment:
      - PROVIDER_URL=http://provider:3001
  provider:
    build: ./provider
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
  pact-broker:
    image: pactfoundation/pact-broker
    ports:
      - "9292:9292"
```

### Docker Best Practices for PACT
- Use multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Mount pact files as volumes for persistence
- Use health checks for service dependencies
- Consider using Docker Compose for local development
