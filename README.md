# PACT Contract Testing Framework

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: This repository is for **educational and testing purposes only**. It provides examples and guidance for learning PACT contract testing concepts. Users are responsible for their own implementation, security, compliance, and production use. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [DISCLAIMER](DISCLAIMER.md) for full terms.

A comprehensive, production-ready PACT-based contract testing framework that covers everything from basic examples to advanced scenarios including bi-directional contracts, performance testing, and CI/CD integration.

## üéØ Purpose

This framework is designed to:
- **Educate** developers on PACT contract testing concepts
- **Demonstrate** best practices and patterns
- **Provide** working examples for learning
- **Guide** implementation of contract testing in real projects

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Run Tests
```bash
# Automated test script with reports (recommended)
npm run test:framework

# Complete test suite with reports
npm run test:reports

# Complete test suite
npm run test:all

# Individual tests
npm run test:simple          # Consumer tests
npm run start:provider       # Start provider server
npm run test:verification    # Provider verification

# View reports
npm run reports:view         # View latest report in browser
npm run reports:list         # List all available reports
```

## üê≥ Docker Usage (Optional)

While this framework doesn't include Docker implementation, you can containerize your PACT testing setup:

### Basic Docker Setup
```bash
# Example Dockerfile for consumer service
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "run", "test:consumer"]

# Example docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  consumer:
    build: .
    environment:
      - PROVIDER_URL=http://provider:3001
  provider:
    build: ./provider
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
  pact-broker:
    image: pactfoundation/pact-broker
    ports:
      - "9292:9292"
```

### Docker Best Practices for PACT
- Use multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Mount pact files as volumes for persistence
- Use health checks for service dependencies
- Consider using Docker Compose for local development
