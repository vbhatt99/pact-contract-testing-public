# GitHub Actions Setup Guide

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: This guide is for **educational and testing purposes only**. The GitHub Actions configurations provided are demonstrations and should not be used in production without proper security review, compliance validation, and customization for your specific environment. Users are responsible for their own implementation, security, compliance, and production use.

## üöÄ Overview

This repository includes comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for PACT contract testing that demonstrate:

- **Automated Testing**: Consumer and provider tests on every push
- **Weekly Scheduled Runs**: Comprehensive testing every Sunday night
- **Security Scanning**: Regular security audits and compliance checks
- **Docker Integration**: Container building and deployment workflows
- **PACT Broker Integration**: Contract management and sharing

## üìÖ Schedule Configuration

### Main CI/CD Pipeline
- **Triggers**:
  - Every push to `main` or `develop` branches
  - Pull requests to `main` branch
  - **Weekly on Sunday at 11:00 PM UTC**
  - Manual triggering via GitHub UI

### Security Scan
- **Triggers**:
  - Every push to `main` branch
  - Pull requests to `main` branch
  - **Weekly on Sunday at 11:00 PM UTC** (same as main CI)
  - Manual triggering via GitHub UI

- Check deployment readiness

### 4. Docker Build and Deploy (`.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`)

**Purpose**: Container building and deployment

**Jobs**:
- `build-and-test`: Build and test Docker images
- `deploy-staging`: Deploy to staging environment
- `deploy-production`: Deploy to production (on tags)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Required Secrets

Set these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

```bash
# PACT Broker Configuration (Optional)
PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL=https://your-pact-broker.com
PACT_BROKER_TOKEN=your-pact-broker-token

# Additional secrets for production use
GITHUB_TOKEN=auto-provided-by-github
```

### Environment Variables

The workflows use these environment variables:

```yaml
# Default values (can be overridden)
PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL: http://localhost:9292
PORT: 3001
NODE_ENV: test
```

## üìä Workflow Execution

### On Push to Main/Develop
1. **Consumer Tests**: Generate PACT contracts
2. **Provider Tests**: Verify contracts against provider
3. **Contract Validation**: Check compatibility
4. **Security Scan**: Audit dependencies and code
5. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing
6. **Deployment Check**: Verify readiness

### Weekly Sunday Night Run
1. **Full Test Suite**: All tests run with latest code
2. **Security Audit**: Comprehensive security scanning
3. **Dependency Check**: Check for outdated packages
4. **Compliance Check**: Validate security practices
5. **Report Generation**: Create summary reports

### On Pull Request
1. **Consumer Tests**: Generate contracts
2. **Provider Tests**: Verify contracts
3. **Security Scan**: Basic security checks
4. **Code Quality**: Linting and formatting

## üîí Security Considerations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Responsibilities

**You are solely responsible for**:
- Implementing proper secret management
- Configuring secure environments
- Setting up access controls
- Ensuring compliance with regulations
- Monitoring and alerting setup

### Best Practices
- Use GitHub secrets for sensitive data
- Enable branch protection rules
- Require status checks for merging
- Regular security audits
- Monitor workflow permissions

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow Not Triggering**
   ```bash
   # Check workflow syntax
   # Verify branch names match
   # Check cron schedule format
   ```

2. **Tests Failing**
   ```bash
   # Check logs in Actions tab
   # Verify dependencies are installed
   # Check environment variables
   ```

3. **PACT Broker Connection**
   ```bash
   # Verify broker URL and token
   # Check network connectivity
   # Validate broker configuration
   ```

### Debug Steps
1. Check workflow logs in GitHub Actions
2. Review artifact contents
3. Test locally with same environment
4. Verify secrets are properly set
5. Check branch protection rules

## üìö Customization

### Modifying Schedule
```yaml
# Change to different day/time
schedule:
  - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Monday at 2 AM UTC
  - cron: '0 9 * * 5'  # Friday at 9 AM UTC
```

### Adding New Jobs
```yaml
jobs:
  new-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Your step
      run: echo "Hello World"
```

### Environment-Specific Configuration
```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
    - name: Deploy
      run: echo "Deploying to production"
```
